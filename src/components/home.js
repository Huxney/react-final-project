      <strong>What is a number?</strong> <br />
      <br />
      <p style={{ maxWidth: "1080px", margin: "auto", textAlign: "justify" }}>
        A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. The
        original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth.
        Numbers can be represented in language with number words. <br />
        <br /> More universally, individual numbers can be represented by
        symbols, called numerals; for example, "5" is a numeral that represents
        the number five. As only a relatively small number of symbols can be
        memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system,
        which is an organized way to represent any number.
        <br />
        <br /> The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral
        system, which allows for the representation of any number using a
        combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits. In
        addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used
        for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial
        numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs). <br />
        <br />
        In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number
        that it represents. In mathematics, the notion of a number has been
        extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational
        numbers such as 1/2 and −2/3, real numbers such as √2 and π, and complex
        numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its
        combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples).
        Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the
        most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
        exponentiation. Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which
        may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers.
        Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance
        throughout the world. For example, in Western society, the number 13 is
        often regarded as unlucky, and "a million" may signify "a lot" rather
        than an exact quantity. <br />
        <br />
        Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical
        significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and
        medieval thought. Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek
        mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number
        theory which are still of interest today. During the 19th century,
        mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share
        certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept.
        Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various
        extensions or modifications of the complex number system. <br />
        <br />
        In modern mathematics, number systems (sets) are considered important
        special examples of more general categories such as rings and fields,
        and the application of the term "number" is a matter of convention,
        without fundamental significance.
